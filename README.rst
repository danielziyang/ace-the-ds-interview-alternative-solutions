Simple repository for storing some answers and code I've written for Nick and Kevin's great book, Ace the Data Science Interview.

Work in progress. 

There are 3 folders in this repo:

1. Ace_the_data_science_interview, intended for some functions/classes that I will write to solve some problems non-analytically.
2. Alternative_solutionss, stores the notebook files for the solutions. 
3. Tests, to check for correctness of simulation code.
